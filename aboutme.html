                <p>This is my school Brooklyn College and Ive been attending this school for the past 3 and half years and i hope to graduate this 
                    Spring 2023. Ive been an undergraute for past couple of years Studying computer science because I want to become a Game Developer.
                     The reason why I want to become a Game Developer is because I love playing games and I would love to participate in making them.

                <p>This is <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/" target="_blank"><span class = "lower">League Of Legends</span></a> my 
                favorite Video game ever since highschool. I feel in love with game after playing just a couple of games and was so inspired by other players and streamers
                to try to strive to become one of the best players in the game. This has been hard because of school but I havent given up. One of the main 
                reasons why I want to become a Game developer is because I want to work for these guys and make a character that everyone will love. I want to be known as a game 
                dev for these guys. only becasue I fell in love with game. so far I just play by myself and I've been grinding the ladder to try to strive to be one of the best players 
                my current rank is Gold 4 and this is my <a href="https://www.op.gg/summoners/na/sulliedking" target="_blank" ><span class="lower">account</span></a>. It 
                does not look as cool as some of my idols, for example <a href="https://www.op.gg/summoners/na/Karasmai%20v9%20" target="_blank"><span class="lower">Karasmai</span></a> 
                but I plan to get there eventually. </p>
